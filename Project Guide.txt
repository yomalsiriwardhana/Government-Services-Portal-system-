🚀 Government Services Portal – Empowering Citizens with Technology

I developed a comprehensive web application that simplifies access to government services for citizens. The portal provides multiple interfaces: traditional browsing, AI-powered search, and personalized recommendations.

Key Highlights:

	Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

	Backend: Python Flask handles server-side logic efficiently.

	Database: MongoDB Atlas stores data securely in the cloud.

	APIs: Facilitates smooth communication between frontend and backend.

	AI-Powered Search: Uses Machine Learning with FAISS for semantic search, understanding the meaning 	behind queries instead of exact word matches.

	Security: Implemented bcrypt for secure password hashing to protect user data.

This project demonstrates how modern web development, AI, and cloud technologies can combine to create a smart, secure, and efficient platform for public service delivery.
